        <!-- Brief Intro re: major and about info-->
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Amy. A few things about me:
        </p>

        <!-- Major -->
        <p>
            I am a in the <strong>Post-Baccalaureate in Computer 
            Science</strong> at Tufts University. My undergrad major 
            was Biochemistry, but as you can tell, I'm back for CS! 
            Check out my <a href="https://github.com/atrinh1996" 
            target="_blank">GitHub</a>! There's not much there at 
            the moment, but stay tuned!
        </p>

        <!-- Hometown -->
        <p>
            I grew up not too far from school in a town called 
            <strong>Chelmsford, MA</strong>. We live by a small lake, 
            that, if I'm honest, I wouldn't swim in.
        </p>

        <!-- Interesting Thing about me -->
        <div id="About Me">
        
        <h3>Something About Me</h3>
        <p>
            You wouldn't be able to tell if you looked at me, but I have an 
            artificial right hip joint. I got it when I was 20. These things 
            are great! The bone had been necrosed because of the steroids I was 
            taking for years for <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lupus/lupus-nephritis#1" target="_blank">Lupus Nephritis</a>, which led 
            to the hypercortisolism and resultant osteoporosis. Range of motion 
            and walking were a nightmare! 
        </p>
        <p>
            After getting over the hurdle of surgery and physical therapy, for 
            which I admittedly usually have low compliance, I felt like a whole 
            new person! This technology and medicine made such a difference and 
            I am so so grateful. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Another neeto device that's really helped my are my scleral lenses. 
            They're really big compared to normal contact lenses. For me, I use 
            them, not for vision, but comfort. They act like prosthetic corneas 
            because mine have uneven surfaces. The lenses make sure nothing 
            touches my cornea and prevents irritating friction from my eyelids.

        <!-- Favorite Picture of a Place -->
        <div id="Place">
        <h3>Charles River in Boston (... I'm pretty sure)</h3>
        <p>

            During my freshman year, my orientation group was taken into the 
            city and we went on a boat ride. I snapped that picture on the 
            river. For some reason I still have this picture years later, and 
            always thought it was a nice one, even if it was a little blurry. 
            I'm pretty sure we were on the Charles. Walking across the 
            Longfellow Bridge when I was in the city was always a favorite 
            because the view was beautiful.
